// A living backdrop for the column: a three.js scene drawn in the theme's
// colours. The scene itself is Backdrop/scene.js — a noise-displaced plane
// in perspective, Stripe's hero technique — and this file is the frame it
// hangs in: one non-interactive WKWebView per backdrop, kept for as long as
// the view is on screen and fed new colours through evaluateJavaScript
// rather than reloaded, and told to stop drawing whenever nobody can see it.
//
// The column's own ground (`ThemeBackdrop` with `live`) keeps its one web
// view for as long as any space is animated, through switches, swipes and
// still spaces in between: a still space hides it (which pauses it), an
// animated one is sent its look with a short fade, and a swipe mixes the
// arriving space in by the fingers. Before, a still space in between tore
// the page down — a new WebContent process and a scene starting again from
// nothing — and every swipe towards an animated space started a second one
// for the curtain, that rarely finished loading before the fingers lifted.
//
// The still gradient the theme would otherwise draw sits underneath: it is
// what shows while the page loads, and all there is if the scene files are
// missing or WebGL is refused.
