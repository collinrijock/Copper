// The mouse buttons past the two: the wheel pressed as a button, and the
// thumb buttons a mouse with side buttons calls back and forward.
//
// Two systems number them differently, and mixing the two is how the middle
// click went missing:
//
// - AppKit's `NSEvent.buttonNumber` counts: 0 left, 1 right, 2 middle,
//   3 back, 4 forward. Those arrive as `.otherMouseDown` / `.otherMouseUp`.
// - WebKit's `WKNavigationAction.buttonNumber` is a mask
//   (WebEventFactory::toNSButtonNumber): 1 left, 2 right, 4 middle, 8 back,
//   16 forward. Upstream tested it against AppKit's 2 — a right button, which
//   never activates a link — so a middle click fell through and navigated
//   the page in place.
//
// The thumb buttons nobody handled: WebKit forwards them to the page as DOM
// buttons 3 and 4 and does nothing else, so they did nothing. A local monitor
// takes them before the page does: over the sidebar they switch spaces, and
// over a page they navigate the pane under the pointer.
