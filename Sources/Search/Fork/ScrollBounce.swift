// The column bounces at its ends, the way Arc's and every native list does:
// scroll past the top or the bottom and the rows stretch away from the edge
// and spring back, whether or not there are enough of them to scroll.
//
// `.scrollBounceBehavior(.always, axes: .vertical)` asks for that, but
// whether SwiftUI carries it through to the NSScrollView underneath has
// varied by release, so the scroll view is also found and told directly:
// elastic up and down, never sideways — a sideways stretch would fight the
// space swipe (Swipes.swift), which owns that axis over the column. The
// column's fade (SideBar.fade) masks the scroll's frame, not its content, so
// rows pulled past an end still run out under the same soft edge.
