import SwiftUI

// The column's ground, as one surface.
//
// Arc's sidebar background never slides. Swipe between two spaces and the
// favourites, the title and the rows travel, but the colour under them
// changes in place — salmon becomes sage across the whole column at once,
// with no edge between the two. So the ground here is one view that is
// always drawn live, never pictured: at rest it is the current space's
// theme; while a slide or a swipe is on it is the outgoing theme blended
// towards the incoming one by the slide's progress. Two plain themes
// (colours and gradients) are morphed stop by stop, so a flat salmon turns
// into a three-stop gradient as one surface; anything with a picture is
// crossfaded; an animated space keeps the column's one scene, which mixes
// its own colours (see AnimatedBackdrop) and fades in or out against a
// still neighbour.
//
// It is plain SwiftUI, sitting as the column's `.background` inside the
// window's own hosting view — the one that already ignores the safe area,
// so the ground runs under the title bar's band where the lights are. An
// earlier version (#18) put it in an NSHostingView of its own so it could
// be hidden for a picture; a hosting view nested like that insets its
// content by the window's safe area, and the top 28–32 points of the
// column came out as the window's white. Nothing here is ever pictured, so
// there is no host and nothing to inset.

/// Two themes and how far between them: 0 is all `from`, 1 all `to`. At
/// rest both are the current space's.
