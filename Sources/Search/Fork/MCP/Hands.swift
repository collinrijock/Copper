//
// Drive keeps one story — the run the timeline pane tells. That is the right
// shape for the pane but the wrong one for the tabs: three terminal agents
// and a Jev run can all be touching pages at once, and the sidebar has to say
// which is which. So beside the run, Drive keeps a Hand per agent session:
// who it is (`Who`), the tabs it touched and when, what it is doing now. The
// tab rows, the bar over the page and the hover card all read these.
//
// A session's identity has to come from the agent's side, because the HTTP
// transport has no sessions of its own. The `--mcp-stdio` bridge and the
// `copper` CLI both run inside the agent's process tree, so they read the
// environment the agent gave them (COPPER_AGENT_LABEL / COPPER_AGENT_THREAD,
// Claude Code's CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID, the working folder) and send it along
// on every request as one `X-Copper-Agent` header. A client that talks HTTP
// directly gets an `Mcp-Session-Id` from `initialize` instead, so two Claude
// Codes on the loopback still read as two.
