// A space switch, the way Arc draws one: the column slides.
//
// Switching swaps `browser.tabs` wholesale (Spaces.select), and left to
// itself the column animated that as every old row leaving and every new one
// arriving — up to a few hundred transitions, each a spring, and every
// colour on the column interpolated from one space's ink to the next's,
// frame after frame for half a second. The main thread spent most of that
// half second in SwiftUI.
//
// Instead the switch is one move, on one ground, with nothing pictured:
//
//   The ground (SpaceGround) is the column's background, drawn live for
//   the whole column — under the lights, the address, the favourites, the
//   rows and the strip — and blended from the old space's theme to the new
//   one's by how far the slide has gone. It never moves.
//
//   The band — the space's name and its rows, one scroll view — travels.
//   One of the two columns in motion is the real, live band; the other is a
//   preview (SpacePreview): the same rows drawn from the space's tabs, with
//   the same parts and measures, in that space's ink, on a clear ground,
//   taking no clicks.
//
//   The lights, the address, the favourites and the strip stay where they
//   are; their ink is mixed from the old space's to the new one's as the
//   slide goes (SlideInk), so a dark column's white glyphs become a light
//   one's brown with the ground, not after it.
//
// On a click or a key the new rows go in with animations off and the live
// band slides in from the side while a preview of the rows that were there
// slides out. After ~0.22 s the preview is dropped and nothing is left of it.
//
// A two-finger swipe (Swipes.swift) drives the same layers by hand, the
// other way round: the live band — the rows on screen — is what the fingers
// pull out, and the space they are heading for comes in as its preview,
// built from its parked tabs so a space never visited this launch looks
// exactly as it will. The previews of both neighbours are kept drawn and
// hidden while nothing moves (SpacePreview.premount), so the first frame of
// a swipe has nothing to build. When the fingers let go, the rest of the
// way is a spring; only once it has landed does the real switch happen,
// under the arriving preview — swapping a column of a hundred rows and its
// page is the one costly frame of a switch (several hundred milliseconds on
// a long column), and done at the end it costs no visible motion where done
// at the lift it froze the dragged frame and then jumped. The live band,
// now the new space's and laid out as the preview was, shows through as the
// preview fades. When the fingers let go short of the way, everything
// springs back and the live band is where it never left.
//
// Which way: towards a space after this one in `Spaces.all`, the old column
// leaves to the left; before it, to the right. Reduce Motion keeps the
// crossfade and drops the travel.
//
// Earlier versions pictured the column (the window's pixels, or the views
// drawn twice over black and white for a matte) and slid the pictures. The
// picture cost up to 55 ms at the moment the fingers moved, a space with no
// picture yet came in blank, and the ground baked into a picture met the
// other ground at a seam. None of that is here.

// MARK: - the layers

// Three layers, on one ground. The ground (SpaceGround, the column's
// background) is live and never pictured: it blends the outgoing theme
// towards the incoming one by `phase`. Over it travel the bands — the live
// one and a preview — carrying their own space's ink and nothing else; and
// over everything the lights, the address, the favourites and the strip
// stay put with their ink mixed between the two spaces'. Nothing holds a
// ground, so there is no edge where one ground meets another and nothing
// to ghost.

/// The band that travels — the space's name and its rows — as the real, live
/// column: in from the side after a click's switch, out under the fingers
/// during a swipe, pulled against the rubber band at an end with nowhere to
/// go, and held to its own edges while it moves so the part still on its
/// way never draws over the page. At rest it is not clipped at all, so
/// nothing that hangs over its edge (a row in the hand, its shadow) is cut.
