// What a space looks like: a colour, a gradient, or a picture, laid over the
// whole column the way Arc lays its themes.
//
// Arc stores a theme as one colour or a few, an intensity, and a grain; it
// draws the column as those colours pulled most of the way from white and
// dimmed a touch, which is why its sidebars read as salmon or sage rather
// than as a pastel wash. The same numbers come in from an Arc import, so a
// moved space looks the way it did. A picture goes under the colour, which
// stays on it thinly so the rows keep one ink.
//
// Everything the column draws on top — favourites, hover, the live pill, the
// hairline — is a translucent white or black over this (see `SpaceTint`), so
// it reads the same over a flat colour, a gradient or a photograph.
//
// Over whichever ground it is, the tone lays black or white, and the ink
// follows it (`SpaceTint` reads `toned`): a space taken most of the way to
// black gets light titles even in the light, and one taken to white gets
// dark ones in the dark.
