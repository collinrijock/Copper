// The space's look, and every surface the column draws over it.
//
// The ground is the space's theme — a colour, a gradient or a picture (see
// `SpaceTheme`), at Arc's strength rather than a pastel wash. Everything on
// top of it is a translucent white or black: the resting favourite a shade
// in, the row under the pointer a shade more, the live pill half-way to
// white. That is how Arc keeps one surface whatever the theme, and it is
// the only way a gradient or a photograph can sit under the rows at all.
// Ink is the theme's own hue taken nearly to black (to white in the dark),
// so a salmon column has warm brown titles, not grey ones.
//
// "Dark" here is the column, not the window. They are the same until a
// theme is toned (or simply chosen) far enough the other way: a column taken
// most of the way to black in light mode is a dark column, and gets light
// ink and white-translucent surfaces, as if the window were dark; a column
// toned to near white in dark mode gets the light column's. The window's own
// appearance is `night`, which only picks the theme's ground.
