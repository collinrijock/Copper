// What an easel tab is spared.
//
// Every tab is built for the open web: a reporter for the scroll position, the
// hide-something picker, a sign-in watcher with a MutationObserver over the
// whole document, a scroll and click listener in the capture phase, the image
// menu, the Chrome Web Store mender, the passkey shim, the ad blocker's rule
// list, and — on every trackpad event — the back/forward swipe: the disc, a
// sideways tracker, and a script in every frame that walks up from the
// pointer through getComputedStyle on each sideways wheel event to say
// whether something under it scrolls. A board is Copper's own page. It has no
// sign-in, no ads, no store, and its two-finger pan is the board's, never
// Back. So an easel tab gets none of that:
//
// - `dress` (Tab.build, once the handlers are on): no pinch magnification
//   (the board zooms itself), the scroll/veil/image/store/passkey handlers
//   off, no content rule list, and the view marked as a board.
// - `arm` (Tab.arm(hiding:), every time a tab is re-armed): every user script
//   off, and one small one in their place that says whether the caret is in
//   something that takes typing — the one thing the sign-in watcher told
//   Copper that a board needs, since Tab belongs to Copper unless it is.
// - `PageView.boardScroll` (PageView.scrollWheel): the event to WebKit and
//   nothing else — no swipe tracking, no ask, no disc. Only the first event
//   of a gesture counts as touching the page.
//
// What stays: the title/address/progress observers, sleep after half an hour
// and the picture it wakes behind, the first-frame fade, the audio watch, and
// the `easel` bridge. Only the defaults key `easels.lean` (NO) turns this off,
// for the bench's before-and-after.
