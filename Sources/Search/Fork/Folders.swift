// Folders, out of the groups that are already there.

// Arc's sidebar folders nest. Copper's groups are flat — one name, one run
// of tabs — but the name carries the nesting: `arc-import` writes a folder
// inside a folder as `Misc › BuildrFi`, and a group whose name starts with
// another group's name and the separator *is* that group's child. So the
// tree is read back out of the names rather than kept twice, and a rename
// carries its children with it (see `Groups.rename`).
//
// Nothing here owns anything. It reads a block's tabs and its groups and
// says what the column should draw, in order, with a depth on every line:
// headers for the folders, rows for the tabs, nothing at all under a folded
// folder — its children's headers included.
