// Two fingers sideways over the column of tabs: the next space, or the last.
//
// The page has a sideways swipe of its own (Swipe.swift, back and forward),
// so this one lives only over the sidebar. A local monitor sees every wheel
// event before the list does; once a gesture has committed to sideways it is
// ours until the fingers lift — and its momentum after, so the list never
// jiggles — and up-and-down is left alone entirely.
//
// Arc's swipe is a hand on the column, not a trigger: the column follows the
// fingers point for point with the next space coming in beside it
// (SpaceSlide.drag), and letting go either carries on — past about two
// fifths of the way, or on a flick — or springs back (SpaceSlide.release).
// Which way the column goes for which way the fingers go is Settings › Tabs
// › Swipe between spaces (`SwipeDirection`): with the fingers (Natural),
// against them (Inverted, the way a page turns the other way), or — the
// default — whichever of the two the Mac's own Natural scrolling setting
// says. The choice is applied once, here, to the fingers' travel and speed,
// so everything downstream — the slide, the springs, the rubber band at the
// first and last space, the Reduce Motion trigger — follows it without
// knowing. Reduce Motion keeps the old trigger: 70 points sideways and the
// space changes, with the crossfade and no travel. Three-finger swipes (when
// System Settings hands them to apps) are a trigger too; they come whole.
