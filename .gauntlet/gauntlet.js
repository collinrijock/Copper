The focused pane has a 2pt outline in the space tint (or the accent); the other pane has none. The divider is invisible until hovered, then a soft 4pt handle; dragging resizes with the existing fraction; double-click on it resets to 50/50.

Today the sidebar branch approximates this with Spaces.carried = "whatever was restored"; replace that with an explicit, persisted flag: Session.Entry.saved (additive; an upstream-shaped file with no flag restores everything as saved, so nothing regresses). arc-import marks Arc's per-space pinned tabs saved and Arc's unpinned as not. (3) Today: everything else, under the hairline and the "New Tab" row, newest at the top like Arc. A tab moves between the two by dragging it across the seam, by a Save / Unsave item in its context menu, and by bench: sections save ID | unsave ID. Groups (folders) live in Saved; a Today tab that joins a group becomes saved. Auto-archive: each tab remembers when it was last active (Entry.seen, additive; set on select and on load); on launch and every 30 minutes, Today tabs not seen for the configured window (default 24h; Settings row 12h/24h/48h/never in Felipe's SettingsFork.swift) are closed through the normal close path so they land in the reopen-closed-tab list (Recall) — never lost. bench: sections archive runs the sweep now; sections lists saved/today counts per space. Visual: the seam stays as the sidebar branch drew it (hairline + New Tab); Saved scrolls without limit, Today takes only what it needs, Arc-style; a subtle "Today" caption above the today list only if it reads calmer than none (Arc has none — prefer none). Keep density and tint exactly as the sidebar piece has them; this is a model change with a small view delta, not a restyle.`,

1. \`cd ${piece.dir ?? tree(piece.key)} && git log --oneline -5 && ./build.sh debug app\`. If the build fails → verdict FAIL, biggest gap = the error, skip to step 5.
2. Take your OWN screenshots: \`.gauntlet/run.sh g-${piece.key} .\` then exactly this scenario — ${piece.scenario} — saving to ${ROOT}/.gauntlet/shots/${piece.key}-r${round + 1}-critic-<what>.png via \`.gauntlet/shot.sh g-${piece.key} <path> .\`.

3. Open the .s.png copies and the references ${piece.refs.map((r) => `${ROOT}/.gauntlet/refs/${r}`).join(', ')} with your image tool. Compare as a senior product designer would: hierarchy, density, alignment, type scale, icon quality (favicons vs letters), tint and contrast, hairlines vs hard borders, spacing rhythm, whether the piece looks like it belongs to the same product as Arc's version, anything that reads as "prototype" or "default SwiftUI". Also try one interaction through the bench that the scope promises (e.g. select another tab, switch space, summon with other text) and make sure it holds.
4. Decide: would a designer shown both call ours the clearly weaker one? If yes → FAIL and name the ONE biggest remaining gap concretely (what, where, what it should be, with pt values or the reference detail to match). If ours holds up next to Arc for this piece's scope ("${piece.title}") → PASS. Do not pass a piece whose favicons are letters, whose panel has a hard 1px border, or whose text sizes are visibly larger than Arc's.
5. Append a <section> to ${ROOT}/.gauntlet/progress.html (piece ${piece.key}, round ${round + 1}, PASS/FAIL, biggest gap, your primary shot beside the reference; paths relative to .gauntlet/). Append only; never rewrite earlier sections.

Your job:
1. In ${ROOT} on branch fork (\`git pull --ff-only\` first; Felipe pushes here too): merge gauntlet/folders (which contains sidebar + sections), then gauntlet/commandbar, then gauntlet/split. Resolve conflicts by keeping both intents (Side.swift and Fork/ files are where they will meet); \`./build.sh debug app\` must pass after each merge. Do not rebase or rewrite history; plain merges are fine here.
2. Make it feel like one product: \`.gauntlet/run.sh g-final\` in ${ROOT} and walk every surface with shots to .gauntlet/shots/final-<what>.png — Exowatt sidebar, Casual with folders open and closed, ⌘K with "goo" and empty, a split of two real pages, the space strip after \`spaces next\`, the Saved/Today seam after \`open https://example.com\`, and dark mode (\`./bench --world g-final ui look dark\` if the look setting exists, else skip). Fix inconsistent radii, tints, type sizes, spacing, leftover hard borders, glyph styles that differ between pieces, anything that crashes or logs errors in /tmp/copper-g-final.log. Also confirm ⌘K's "Switch to <space>", split via ⌘⇧D's bench twin, and folder toggling all still work through the bench.
3. PATCHES.md must list every upstream file the merged fork now touches, one row per hook group; COLLIN.md's status table gets a line per piece (shipped / partly). Commit in small logical commits on fork and push (\`git push\`). Do not touch main.
4. Remove the worktrees when done: \`git worktree remove --force ${TREES}/<piece>\` for each of sidebar, sections, folders, commandbar, split, and \`git branch -D gauntlet/<piece>\` only after confirming its commits are in fork (\`git branch --merged fork\`). Then \`.gauntlet/stop.sh all\` — no gauntlet Copper may be left running.
5. Append a final "Smoothing" section to .gauntlet/progress.html with before/after pairs for the sidebar and ⌘K (before-*.png vs final-*.png).
