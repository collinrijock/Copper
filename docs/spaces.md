# Spaces

A space is a row of tabs of its own — its favourites, its saved rows, its
Today — with a name, a colour the whole column is washed in, an icon, and
optionally a profile (a cookie jar of its own). One space is on screen at a
time; the others are parked and come back exactly as they were.

## Where the space shows

**The header.** Under the traffic lights, above the favourites: the space's
mark and its name in full. Hover it for the tab count; click it (or the
chevron) for the space menu. This is the label the column used to lack.

**The strip at the foot.** Every space is a 22pt chip — its emoji, its
symbol, or its first letter, on a soft square of its own colour. The current
one sits on the column's paper-white pill, the same thing the live row wears.
Hovering a chip names it at once, above the strip. When the chips outgrow the
column the row scrolls sideways under a soft edge, with the current chip kept
in view; nothing shrinks to a dot and no name is ever cut to a letter. Drag a
chip to reorder the spaces. The `+` at the end makes a space *and opens its
editor*, so it gets a name, an icon and a colour straight away.

## The space menu

From the header, a chip's right-click, or ⌘K:

- **Edit Space…** — the popover below.
- **New Tab in Space** — switches there if needed.
- **Move Current Tab Here** — on any space but the current one.
- **Move Left / Move Right** — reorder without dragging.
- **Colour ›** — the named palette, each with its swatch.
- **Profile ›** — Shared, the names in use, New Profile….
- **Delete Space…** — see below. Only when there is more than one space.

## Edit Space

One popover: the name (autofocused; ⏎ closes), a row of symbols and an
emoji field for the icon, the colour swatches, the profile picker, and
**Delete Space…** at the bottom. Every change lands as it is made — the
header re-titles and the column re-tints while the popover is up.

## Colours

Ten names, not degrees: **Graphite** (the plain grey), **Copper, Orange,
Yellow, Green, Teal, Blue, Indigo, Pink, Red**. A new space takes the first
colour no other space is wearing — never grey by default; grey is a choice.
A space restored from an older session or imported from Arc keeps whatever
hue it had; the picker shows it as the nearest name. `SpaceTint`
(`Fork/SpaceTint.swift`) turns the hue into everything the column draws.

## Deleting

Delete asks first — *"Delete 'Work'? Its 12 tabs will close."* — with
**Close Tabs & Delete**, **Move Tabs to 'Home' & Delete** (the neighbour to
the left, or to the right for the first space) and **Cancel**. A space with
no tabs asks with a plain **Delete**. The last space cannot be deleted.

## Shortcuts

| | |
|---|---|
| ⌃N | New Space |
| ⌃⌥← / ⌃⌥→ | Previous / next space |
| ⌃1 … ⌃9 | Switch to the nth space |
| two-finger swipe over the column | Previous / next space |
| ⌘K | New Space, Edit Space, Delete Space…, Switch to *name* |

## The model

`Space { id, name, hue: Double?, profile: String?, icon: String? }` — all of
it in `session.json` under `spaces`. `icon` is an emoji or an SF symbol name
behind `sf:`; it is optional, so a session written by an older build reads,
and an older build reading a newer file ignores it. Nothing else about the
file changed. `Fork/Spaces.swift` is the model, `Fork/SpacesUI.swift` the
views (header, strip, editor, menu, delete sheet).

## The bench

```
./bench spaces                              list: index, name, icon, tabs, profile, colour
./bench spaces new NAME                     a space in an unused colour, made current
./bench spaces select N|NAME | next | prev
./bench spaces icon N|NAME 📚|sf:flask|none
./bench spaces colour N|NAME Teal|…|Graphite
./bench spaces reorder N|NAME M             move a space to index M
./bench spaces move N|NAME                  the active tab, into that space
./bench spaces remove N|NAME [--keep]       --keep moves its tabs to the neighbour
./bench spaces edit [N|NAME]                the editor popover, on the header
./bench spaces delete N|NAME                the Delete sheet (prints its text)
./bench spaces answer close|move|cancel     press one of the sheet's buttons
./bench ui width 176                        the column's width, for a look
```
