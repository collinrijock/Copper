# The website — copper-browser.github.io/Copper

Copper's landing page is a single static page in [`site/`](../site), served by GitHub Pages at
**https://copper-browser.github.io/Copper/** and republished automatically whenever `site/`
changes on `fork`.

## How it is hosted

| Piece | Setting |
|---|---|
| Source of truth | `site/` on branch `fork` |
| Pages source | **Deploy from a branch** → `gh-pages`, folder `/` (legacy build type) |
| `gh-pages` | Generated. It is `git subtree split --prefix site` of `fork`, so it holds only the site's files and history. Never commit to it by hand. |
| HTTPS | Enforced |
| Jekyll | Off (`site/.nojekyll`) — files are served exactly as committed |

Check the live configuration and last build:

```sh
gh api repos/copper-browser/Copper/pages --jq '{status, html_url, build_type, source}'
gh api repos/copper-browser/Copper/pages/builds/latest --jq '{status, commit, created_at, error: .error.message}'
```

`pages/builds/latest.commit` should equal `git rev-parse origin/gh-pages`, and that should equal
`git subtree split -q --prefix site origin/fork`.

## How it deploys (CI/CD)

[`.github/workflows/site.yml`](../.github/workflows/site.yml):

1. Runs on every push to `fork` that touches `site/**` (or the workflow itself), and on demand
   (`gh workflow run site.yml -R copper-browser/Copper`).
2. Checks out with full history, runs `git subtree split -q --prefix site HEAD`, and
   force-pushes the result to `gh-pages` with the workflow's own `GITHUB_TOKEN`
   (`permissions: contents: write` — no secrets, no deploy keys).
3. GitHub's built-in `pages-build-deployment` job then publishes `gh-pages`. The new page is
   live about a minute after the push.

The split is deterministic, so re-running on an unchanged `site/` pushes the same commit and
changes nothing. `concurrency: site-pages` with `cancel-in-progress` means only the newest push
deploys.

**Rollback:** revert the offending commit on `fork` (the workflow republishes the previous
content), or in an emergency push an older split straight to Pages:
`git push --force origin "$(git subtree split -q --prefix site <good-commit>):refs/heads/gh-pages"`.

**If a deploy looks stuck:** `gh run list -R copper-browser/Copper --workflow site.yml` for our
job, then `gh run list -R copper-browser/Copper --workflow pages-build-deployment` for GitHub's.
Pages builds of `gh-pages` are triggered even though the push came from `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

**Setting it up from scratch** (e.g. a new repo): push a `gh-pages` branch once
(`git push origin "$(git subtree split -q --prefix site HEAD):refs/heads/gh-pages"`), enable
Pages on it (`gh api -X POST repos/<owner>/<repo>/pages -f 'source[branch]=gh-pages' -f 'source[path]=/'`),
and add `site.yml`.

## Editing the page

- Everything is in `site/index.html`: inline CSS and a little vanilla JS. No framework, no build
  step, no external fonts, CDNs, analytics or trackers. Assets live in `site/assets/`.
- Every path is relative (the site lives under `/Copper/`), except `og:image`/`og:url`, which
  must be absolute (`https://copper-browser.github.io/Copper/...`) for link previews.
- Light and dark follow `prefers-color-scheme`, with a toggle stored in `localStorage`
  (`copper-theme`). Captures come in pairs (`*-dark.*`); `window.copperMedia` in the `<head>`
  picks the pair that matches.
- Videos are `<video autoplay muted loop playsinline preload="metadata" poster=…>`; under
  `prefers-reduced-motion` only the poster shows.
- Hard rules: no horizontal scrolling at any width ≥ 360 px; AA contrast in both themes; real
  focus styles. Copper is presented on its own — the page names no other browser project as its
  origin. Facts on the page come from this repo's README and `docs/`; don't invent features.
- Install commands must match what `release.yml` publishes: the tap
  (`brew install --cask copper-browser/copper/copper`), the installer
  (`releases/latest/download/copper-install.sh`) and the zip
  (`releases/latest/download/copper-macos-arm64.zip`). See README › Installing.

### Preview and QA before pushing

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8000 -d site      # then open http://localhost:8000/
```

Check at 1440 (light and dark), 834, 390 and 360 px: `document.documentElement.scrollWidth <=
innerWidth`, no console errors or failed requests, the copy buttons, the ⌘K palette and the
hide-banner demo in "Try it here", and the theme toggle. Playwright's bundled Chromium cannot
play H.264, so check the videos in Safari or Chrome.

## Captures (screenshots and loops)

Every image and video of the app on the page is a real capture of Copper, made by
[`site-capture/`](../site-capture) against a separate **headless** Copper, so the browser you
are using is never touched:

| Asset | What it shows | Made with |
|---|---|---|
| `copper-google(-dark).webp` | Copper on google.com with the Personal space | `compose.py still` |
| `copper-motion(-dark).mp4/.webp` | tab switch, ⌘K filtering, a space switch, tabs on top and back | `rec_motion.py` → `compose.py video` |
| `copper-jev(-dark).mp4/.webp` | a real Jev run: "Search Wikipedia for patina and stop when the article is visible", with the driver timeline | `rec_jev.py` → `compose.py video` |

Recipe:

1. `site-capture/launch.sh` downloads the latest release into `$COPPER_SHOOT`
   (default `/tmp/copper-shoot`), builds the `hidpi.m` shim (real 2× pixels and active-looking
   window controls), and starts it headless in probe world `sitepics` on MCP port 4196.
   `./bench` needs the `bench` default on (`defaults write com.collinrijock.copper bench -bool true`).
2. Set the world up with public pages only — never sign in to anything. The current captures use
   three spaces: Personal (google.com, Wikipedia "Patina", apple.com/mac,
   news.ycombinator.com), Work (w3.org, swift.org, webkit.org) and Reading (Wikipedia: Statue of
   Liberty, Verdigris, Patina). For Jev, the world needs its own `intelligence.json` (0600) in
   `~/Library/Application Support/Copper (sitepics)/`; keep keys, settings pages and internal
   URLs out of every frame.
3. Record: `cb.py` grabs whole-window PNGs over the bench socket (the bench `window` verb — no
   window is brought forward) as fast as it can. `rec_motion.py <outdir>` scripts the tab/space
   tour; `rec_jev.py <outdir> "<goal>"` records while `site-capture/cop run "<goal>"` drives
   the page.
4. Compose: `compose.py still IN.png OUT.png --theme light|dark` or
   `compose.py video FRAMEDIR OUT.mp4 --start T --end T --fps 30 --theme … [--fade S]` puts the
   window on the warm backdrop with a macOS-style shadow at 2240×1480 and encodes H.264
   (`yuv420p`, `+faststart`, CRF 26, no audio), writing a poster PNG next to it. Convert stills
   and posters to WebP with `cwebp -q 82`. Keep each video under ~2.5 MB.
5. Stop only the capture instance: `kill "$(cat "$COPPER_SHOOT/PID")"`.
