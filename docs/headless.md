# Headless Copper — a browser for a Mac nobody sits at

*`Copper --headless` (or `SEARCH_HEADLESS=1`): the same browser, run by a daemon — the grunts Mac
mini — with no Dock icon, no menu bar, no window on any display, and nothing that waits for a
click. The loopback MCP server and the grunts link run exactly as in the windowed app; they are
the only way in. Implementation: `Sources/Search/Fork/Headless.swift`. For the tools themselves
read [agents.md](agents.md); for the link, [grunts-link.md](grunts-link.md).*

## Run it

```sh
/Applications/Copper.app/Contents/MacOS/Copper --headless        # or
SEARCH_HEADLESS=1 /Applications/Copper.app/Contents/MacOS/Copper
```

It needs a logged-in GUI (Aqua) session — WebKit renders through the WindowServer — but nobody
has to look at it. Logs go to stderr, one line each, prefixed `copper[headless]:`; keys never
appear in them.

What changes when headless is on (and nothing here runs when it is off):

| | Windowed | Headless |
|---|---|---|
| Activation policy | regular (Dock icon, menu bar) | **accessory** — no Dock icon, never takes the menu bar |
| `NSApp.activate` | brings Copper forward | **ignored** (logged); if LaunchServices activates the app anyway it deactivates at once |
| Browser window | on screen | **parked outside every display** (see *The window*) |
| JS `alert` / `confirm` / `prompt`, certificate and HTTP-auth sheets, extension permission alerts | a sheet on the window | **declined on the spot** (`confirm()` → false, `prompt()` → null, bad certificate → not excused, sign-in → cancelled) and logged |
| Open/save panels (file inputs, downloads "Save as…") | a sheet | **cancelled**, logged |
| Camera / microphone asks | a bar at the bottom | **denied**, logged |
| Keychain prompts | a dialog | none — reads that would prompt fail (`errSecInteractionNotAllowed`) |
| First-run Welcome panel | shown once | **suppressed** |
| "Reopen windows?" after a crash | AppKit may ask | off (`ApplePersistenceIgnoreState`) |
| App Nap | macOS decides | held off — the process is a server |
| SIGTERM | ends the process | a normal quit, so the session's last write is flushed |
| Session restore | silent | silent (unchanged; tabs come back) |
| `grunts.announces` | `true` says each bot call in the bottom line | unchanged — `false` is silent, `true` draws into a window nobody sees |

**Agent switches.** Headless has no Settings, so two switches in `agent.json` default to **on**
when the file does not mention them: `enabled` (the loopback server) and `jev` (Jev mode). An
explicit `false` is respected. The grunts daemon only writes the `grunts` object, so a fresh mini
comes up serving the loopback on 4123 with Jev tools.

## The window

WebKit has to lay pages out and paint them — Jev indexes elements by geometry, agents take
screenshots, `browser_click` posts real events into the window. So the browser keeps its one
window and parks it:

- **`SEARCH_HEADLESS_WINDOW=offscreen`** (default). The window is ordered in, but placed below
  and left of every display (`Parking.origin`), with shadow, mouse events and the Windows menu
  off. AppKit keeps running layout and display for it. A window outside every display counts as
  occluded, and WebKit treats an occluded page as a background tab (no painting, no
  `requestAnimationFrame`, `document.hidden`, and in a shipped build a WebContent process that may
  be suspended), so each web view is told to ignore occlusion as it joins the window
  (`_setWindowOcclusionDetectionEnabled:`, WebKit SPI). Pages see `visibilityState == "visible"`
  and animate at display rate. `CGWindowList` shows one window, `kCGWindowIsOnscreen = true`,
  bounds outside every display.
- **`SEARCH_HEADLESS_WINDOW=hidden`**. The window is never ordered in (`CGWindowList`: zero
  on-screen windows). Snapshots, `jev_observe`, screenshots and clicks still work — the web view
  stays in its window at full size — but the page is a background tab to WebKit:
  `document.hidden`, no `requestAnimationFrame`. Fine for reading; not what the tools were tuned
  against.

`SEARCH_HEADLESS_SIZE=WxH` sets the parked window's size (default `1440x900`; the page's viewport
is that less the sidebar). The parked frame is never written to the window autosave, so the
windowed app on the same Mac comes back where it was. A screen change or anything that moves the
window back onto a display puts it back in its parking spot.

How it is wired: no upstream file is touched. The window ordering calls (`makeKeyAndOrderFront:`,
`orderFront:`, `orderFrontRegardless`, `orderWindow:relativeTo:`), `constrainFrameRect:toScreen:`,
`setFrameAutosaveName:`, `NSApp.activate…`, `NSAlert`/`NSSavePanel`/`NSOpenPanel` modal and sheet
entry points and `NSApplication.runModalForWindow:` are intercepted at the AppKit level (method
swizzling, installed only when headless is on), so every existing call site — `Links`, `Browser`,
`Extensions`, `Dialogs`, `Input` — is covered without a hook in each. `Bridge.runIfAsked` boots
headless before SwiftUI builds a window; `MCP.start(for:)` finishes it once the browser exists.

## Environment

| Variable / flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--headless`, `SEARCH_HEADLESS=1` | headless mode (`1`, `true`, `yes`, `on`) |
| `SEARCH_HEADLESS_WINDOW` | `offscreen` (default) or `hidden` |
| `SEARCH_HEADLESS_SIZE` | parked window size, `WxH`, default `1440x900` |
| `SEARCH_MCP_PORT` | listen on this port instead of `agent.json`'s, without writing it back. Works in any mode; the CLI and `--mcp-stdio` honour it too (the CLI's older `COPPER_AGENT_PORT` still wins when both are set) |
| `SEARCH_HEADLESS_DEBUG` | extra parking/occlusion lines in the log |

## Keys: `copper intelligence`

The Jev (TypeSafe) and router (LiteLLM) keys live in `intelligence.json` beside `agent.json`
(mode 0600). Three ways to change them without Settings, none of which ever prints a key:

```sh
copper intelligence status
# {"jevModel":"jev-latest","jevReady":true,"routerModel":"sonnet","routerReady":true,"routerURL":"https://llm.dev.exowatt.com"}
copper intelligence set --jev ts-… --router-key sk-… --router-url https://llm.dev.exowatt.com --router-model sonnet --text-model haiku
echo "$ROUTER_KEY" | copper intelligence set --router-key -     # `-` reads the value from stdin (keeps it out of `ps`)
copper intelligence reload                                      # re-read intelligence.json
kill -HUP <copper pid>                                          # same as reload
```

- `set` goes through the loopback server's `copper/intelligence` method and writes through
  `Intelligence.shared.keys` — the file is saved 0600 exactly as Settings saves it. The answer is
  the status plus `applied: ["jevKey", …]` (names, never values). A non-http(s) `--router-url` is
  refused (exit 1).
- `status` is `{jevReady, routerReady, routerURL, routerModel, jevModel}`.
- **External writers** (the grunts daemon applying a provisioned `keys` payload) JSON-merge into
  `intelligence.json` and then send **SIGHUP**; Copper re-reads the file on the main queue and
  logs `intelligence.json reloaded on SIGHUP — jevReady …, routerReady …`. No restart. Copper
  rewrites the whole file on its next own save, so keys it does not know are not preserved.
- Like `copper link`, it needs the loopback server (on by default in headless).

Loopback method, for scripts that speak JSON-RPC directly (bearer from `agent.json`; loopback
only — never reachable through the grunts link):

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"copper/intelligence","params":{"op":"set","jevKey":"ts-…"}}
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"copper/intelligence","params":{"op":"status"}}
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":3,"method":"copper/intelligence","params":{"op":"reload"}}
```

## Health

`GET /health` (no auth) and `copper health --json` carry `headless: true|false`; headless adds
`headlessWindow: {window, windowsOnScreen, webViews, webViewsIgnoringOcclusion}`, and `/health`
also says the `port` actually listened on.

```sh
copper health --json
# {"headless":true,"health":{"headless":true,"headlessWindow":{"webViews":1,"webViewsIgnoringOcclusion":1,
#   "window":"offscreen","windowsOnScreen":0},"mcp":"/mcp","name":"copper","port":4123,"running":true,"version":"…"},"jev":true}
```

## launchd (the grunts daemon's recipe)

`grunts mac copper install` writes `~/Library/LaunchAgents/dev.grunts.copper.plist` (paths must
be absolute — launchd does not expand `~`):

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
  <key>Label</key><string>dev.grunts.copper</string>
  <key>ProgramArguments</key>
  <array>
    <string>/Users/USER/.grunts/Copper.app/Contents/MacOS/Copper</string>
    <string>--headless</string>
  </array>
  <key>RunAtLoad</key><true/>
  <key>KeepAlive</key><dict><key>SuccessfulExit</key><false/></dict>
  <key>ProcessType</key><string>Background</string>
  <key>LimitLoadToSessionType</key><string>Aqua</string>
  <key>StandardOutPath</key><string>/Users/USER/Library/Logs/grunts/copper.log</string>
  <key>StandardErrorPath</key><string>/Users/USER/Library/Logs/grunts/copper.log</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

```sh
launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/dev.grunts.copper.plist
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/dev.grunts.copper     # restart
launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u)/dev.grunts.copper          # stop (SIGTERM → clean quit, exit 0, not restarted)
```

- `LimitLoadToSessionType Aqua`: the job exists only in a logged-in GUI session — WebKit needs
  the WindowServer. On a mini with no one at it, turn on automatic login.
- `KeepAlive {SuccessfulExit: false}`: a crash is restarted; a SIGTERM quit (exit 0) is not.
- Data: Copper's default folder, `~/Library/Application Support/Copper/`. The daemon JSON-merges
  `grunts: {enabled, api, token, name: "copper", announces: false}` into `agent.json` (0600).
- `ProcessType Background` puts the process under the system's background CPU/IO clamps; Copper
  is the process that drives WebKit and answers every tool call, so if Jev runs feel slow on a
  busy mini, `Standard` (or dropping the key) is the thing to try first.

## Probing it without touching a real profile

```sh
export SDKROOT=/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX26.5.sdk SEARCH_SIGN_IDENTITY=-; ./build.sh
open -n -g --stderr /tmp/copper-headless.log \
  --env SEARCH_PROBE=headless --env SEARCH_HEADLESS=1 --env SEARCH_MCP_PORT=4193 --env SEARCH_MEASURE=1 \
  build/Copper.app            # world "Copper (headless)"; -g so it is never brought forward
export SEARCH_PROBE=headless SEARCH_MCP_PORT=4193
build/Copper.app/Contents/MacOS/Copper --cli --json health
build/Copper.app/Contents/MacOS/Copper --cli open https://example.com
build/Copper.app/Contents/MacOS/Copper --cli observe
build/Copper.app/Contents/MacOS/Copper --cli shot /tmp/headless.png
build/Copper.app/Contents/MacOS/Copper --cli intelligence set --jev ts-test
kill <that pid only>
```

`SEARCH_PROBE=<name>` keeps the data in its own world; `SEARCH_MCP_PORT` keeps it off the
windowed Copper's 4123; `SEARCH_MEASURE=1` keeps WebKit's shipped background policy, so the probe
sees what a real headless run sees. `CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo` filtered by the pid is the
reliable window count (System Events needs Accessibility, and two processes are named Copper).

## What it cannot do

- Run without a GUI login. The WindowServer is required; `LimitLoadToSessionType Aqua` says so.
- Answer anything. Every dialog is "no": a site that needs `confirm()` to proceed, a file upload,
  camera/microphone, a self-signed certificate on a public host, HTTP basic auth, or a keychain
  item that would prompt all fail closed. Passkeys that need Touch ID cannot be used.
- Be focused. The app is never active, so `document.hasFocus()` is false — the same as a
  windowed Copper behind other apps, which the tools already handle.
- Zero windows *and* a painting page at once: `offscreen` has one ordered-in window outside every
  display; `hidden` has none but pages are background tabs.
- `./bench window` (WindowServer pictures of the window) shows the parked window's pixels only if
  the screen-recording grant allows it; use `browser_take_screenshot`.
