# easel-web

The canvas page Copper serves at `copper-easel://easel/<id>`: a FigJam-style
board with stickies (live markdown), frames (with pictures), arrows and a
laser pointer. P1 is local-only with no sign-in; the contract with the Swift
side is `docs/plans/2026-10-01-easels-p1-local.md`.

## Dev

```sh
cd easel-web
npm install            # .npmrc sets legacy-peer-deps (npm 11.0.0 chokes on vitest 4's peer set)
npm run dev            # http://127.0.0.1:5291/  (strict port)
npm run typecheck
env -i "HOME=$HOME" "PATH=$PATH" TERM=xterm npx vitest run   # the P3 shell env otherwise crashes tinypool
```

Dependency versions are pinned to what gruntworks runs (react 19.3,
yjs 13.6.33, @tiptap 3.31.3, marked 17.0.6) so the two canvases keep sharing
code.

## Build

```sh
npm run build
```

Writes `../Sources/Search/Fork/Easel/web/` (`index.html` + `assets/`, Vite
`base: '/'`). Copper builds with SwiftPM only, so **commit the output**; native
copies the folder as a resource like `Fork/Backdrop` and the scheme handler
serves `/<id>` → `index.html`, `/assets/<file>` → `assets/`. Nothing is fetched
from the network at runtime (system fonts, inline SVG icons, one chunk).

## Standalone mode

When `window.webkit?.messageHandlers?.easel` is missing (Vite, Playwright) the
page fakes the host (`src/host/standalone.ts`): the easel id comes from `?id=`
(default `00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000001`), `save` goes to
`localStorage['easel:<id>']`, pictures become object URLs with a data-URL copy
in localStorage so a reload still shows them. The viewer is `You` / `#ff5a36`.

The visual check lives in
`~/Developer/super-charles-personal/research/2026-10-01-copper-easels/web/visual-check.mjs`
(playwright-core, `channel: 'chrome'`, real mouse — synthetic PointerEvents do
not work on this canvas because `setPointerCapture` rejects fake pointer ids).

## Layout

| path | what |
|---|---|
| `src/host/` | `Host` interface, `copperHost` (the bridge), `standaloneHost`, base64 |
| `src/doc/` | `createEaselDoc()` (shapes + meta + undo), `createSaver()` / `wireFlush()` |
| `src/lib/` | pure canvas math, resize, tools, markdown, images, awareness; `camera.ts`, `live-boxes.ts`, `store.ts` (board state outside React); `sticky-static.ts` (a note's HTML without an editor) |
| `src/components/` | the board (`easel-page.tsx`), shapes, sticky editor, toolbar, title chip, cursors; `board-context.tsx` (camera, live boxes, editing, marquee), `board-overlays.tsx` (marquee, laser) |
| `src/debug.ts` | `window.__easelDebug`: seed a board, frame times, render counts (inert until called) |
| `src/laser/` | **stub** with the contract's exports; the laser branch replaces it |
| `src/session.ts` | open an easel: `ready` → doc → saver → awareness |
| `src/__tests__/` | vitest (jsdom opt-in per file) |

## Staying fast

The board re-renders only when the document, the selection or the tool
changes. Everything that moves at input rate lives outside React state:

- **Camera** (`lib/camera.ts`): wheel, pinch and pan move a target; once a
  frame the camera writes the layer `transform` and the dot grid's
  `background-position/size` to the DOM, then tells the few screen-space
  readers (laser, cursors, selection bar, zoom %, handles, marquee). A pan or
  zoom commits nothing in `EaselPage`.
- **Live boxes** (`lib/live-boxes.ts`): a drag, resize or drawn box moves only
  the shapes involved (and the arrows on them); the doc is written once on
  release, one undo step.
- **Shapes** are memoized; the doc snapshot keeps every untouched `Shape`
  object, so an edit re-renders one note.
- **Stickies** render static HTML (`lib/sticky-static.ts`: same extensions,
  same serializer, same DOM as the editor) and mount TipTap only while being
  edited.
- **Awareness**: local cursor and laser updates never re-render anything.

Measure with the harness in
`~/Developer/super-charles-personal/research/2026-10-01-copper-easels/perf/`
(`node perf.mjs --label x`, WebKit + Chrome at 2×, 60-sticky board).

## How it talks to Copper

- `ready` once on load → `config {easel, viewer, state, mode}`. `state` is applied
  with `Y.applyUpdate` under the origin `easel:load`, which the saver ignores.
- `save {state, title}` ≤ 500 ms after the last change, and at once on
  `visibilitychange` → hidden, `pagehide`, and a native `flush` (forced: it saves
  even with nothing pending). `state` is always the whole doc
  (`Y.encodeStateAsUpdate`), base64.
- `file {reqId, name, mime, data}` for every picture (after client-side
  downscaling to ≤ 2400 px / WebP when it is big or not png/jpeg/gif/webp);
  `file:done {reqId, fileId, url}` → the frame stores `image: file:<fileId>` and
  renders `copper-easel://easel/files/<easelId>/<fileId>`.
- `open {url}` for links clicked in an unfocused sticky (http/https only).
- `rename {title}` from native (sidebar rename) sets `meta.title` and saves.
- `log {level, message}` for uncaught errors and failed picture adds.
- `document.title` always equals the easel's title (`meta.title`, default
  "Untitled Easel"); the title chip top-left edits it. A new easel takes
  `config.easel.title` / `createdAt` into `meta` once (that is its first save).

## Lifted from gruntworks

Copied out of `~/Developer/gruntworks/apps/web/src/modules/wiki/` (read-only
there) and adapted: no `@/auth`, `@/data`, React Query, TanStack Router, `@/ui`,
Tailwind `gw-*` tokens or Font Awesome.

Left out of P1 on purpose: page cards, the wiki drawer, page search, comments,
reactions, closed cards, ring layout and stage, canvas grunt chat and hand-off.
